The view by the campsite is truly a wonder and if you’re lucky, you’ll see a sea of clouds which the mountain was named for. By the way, the camping fee is good for a group of seven.

There is no clear signage when you enter so we didnt know if we had to stop or where the office even was. We slowly drove up and some guy was rude to us. We are local people trying to give them business during a crazy time, and he basically was mad that we drove onto the property at all. Wont be coming here.

One gentleman helped a friend of ours with the use of his tools and his time. The owners were very friendly and even came by to see if we needed anything. We were also invited to a community fire. The sites were pretty good in size. We went late in the camping seasons so the pool was closed. We plan to go back next year. Our friends are considering purchasing a seasonal site.
